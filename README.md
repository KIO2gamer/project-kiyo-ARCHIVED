    ```

3.  **Configuration:**

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

    ```plaintext
    # Discord Configuration
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret
    DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=your_discord_redirect_uri
    DISCORD_GUILD_IDS=your_discord_guild_ids
    
    # Database Configuration
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    
    # API Keys
