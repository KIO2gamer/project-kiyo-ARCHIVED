# Implementation Plan

-   [x] 1. Analyze current codebase and create cleanup report

    -   Write script to scan all source files for require/import statements
    -   Generate dependency usage analysis comparing package.json with actual imports
    -   Create command functionality assessment by testing each command category
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 5.1_

-   [x] 2. Remove unused npm dependencies

    -   Remove unused packages from package.json based on analysis
    -   Test bot startup after each dependency removal to ensure no breaking changes
    -   Update package-lock.json by running npm install
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

-   [x] 3. Clean up broken or unnecessary API integration commands

    -   Remove or fix commands in API_Integrations folder that use missing/invalid API keys
    -   Update error handling for remaining API commands to gracefully handle failures
    -   Remove hardcoded API URLs that are no longer functional
    -   _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

-   [x] 4. Remove overly specific or low-value fun commands

    -   Remove commands like "do_not_touch", "skibidi", and other meme-specific commands from funCmds.js
    -   Consolidate remaining fun commands into more generic, reusable implementations
    -   Preserve the Fun_And_Entertainment folder structure
    -   _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

-   [x] 5. Consolidate redundant utility functions

    -   Merge similar error handling patterns in utils/errorHandler.js
    -   Consolidate string manipulation functions in utils/stringUtils.js
    -   Remove duplicate permission checking logic across utility files
    -   _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

-   [x] 6. Remove development and testing artifacts

    -   Remove eval command from Admin_And_Configuration (security risk)
    -   Clean up console.log statements and replace with proper Logger calls
    -   Remove commented-out code and TODO comments
    -   _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

-   [x] 7. Streamline configuration and environment variables

    -   Update .env.example to only include actually used environment variables
    -   Remove unused configuration options from the config object in index.js
    -   Simplify bot presence configuration to remove overly complex rotation logic
    -   _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

-   [x] 8. Update command loading and registration system

    -   Ensure command loader handles empty folders gracefully after command removal
    -   Update help command to reflect removed commands and categories
    -   Test command registration process with cleaned up command structure
    -   _Requirements: 5.3, 6.3_

-   [ ] 9. Clean up unused database schemas

    -   Verify which database schemas are actually unused by checking for dynamic imports and string references
    -   Remove confirmed unused schemas like ReactionRole.js that have no references in the codebase
    -   Update any remaining references to removed schemas
    -   Test database connections after schema removal
    -   _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

-   [ ] 10. Remove unused utility files

    -   Remove commandUtils.js and stringUtils.js if they are confirmed to have no usages
    -   Verify no dynamic imports or string-based references exist for these utilities
    -   Update any remaining references to use consolidated utility functions
    -   _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

-   [ ] 11. Final optimization and verification

    -   Run comprehensive testing of all remaining commands to ensure functionality
    -   Verify bot startup performance improvements after cleanup
    -   Update README.md to reflect final cleaned up features and dependencies
    -   Run ESLint and Prettier for final code formatting
    -   _Requirements: 6.3, 7.3_
