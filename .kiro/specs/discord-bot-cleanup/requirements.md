# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up unnecessary features and code in the Discord bot codebase while maintaining the existing commands structure. The goal is to remove redundant functionality, unused dependencies, outdated features, and improve overall code maintainability without breaking the core command system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused dependencies and packages, so that the bot has a smaller footprint and fewer security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package.json dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify packages that are not imported or used in any source files
2. WHEN unused dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL remove them from package.json
3. WHEN removing dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify no breaking changes occur to existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove deprecated or broken API integrations, so that the bot doesn't have non-functional features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining API integration commands THEN the system SHALL identify commands that use deprecated or non-functional APIs
2. WHEN broken API integrations are found THEN the system SHALL either fix them or remove them
3. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation or removal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate redundant utility functions, so that the codebase is more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing utility files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate or similar functionality
2. WHEN redundant utilities are found THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into single implementations
3. WHEN consolidating utilities THEN the system SHALL update all references to use the consolidated version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused database schemas and models, so that the database structure is cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining database models THEN the system SHALL identify schemas that are not referenced in any commands or events
2. WHEN unused schemas are found THEN the system SHALL remove them from the database directory
3. WHEN removing schemas THEN the system SHALL ensure no commands depend on the removed models

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up overly complex or unnecessary commands, so that the bot focuses on essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing commands THEN the system SHALL identify commands with minimal usage value or overly complex implementations
2. WHEN unnecessary commands are found THEN the system SHALL remove them while preserving the folder structure
3. WHEN removing commands THEN the system SHALL ensure the command loading system continues to work properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove development-only or testing code from production files, so that the codebase is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining source files THEN the system SHALL identify development-only code, debug statements, and test artifacts
2. WHEN development code is found THEN the system SHALL remove it from production files
3. WHEN removing development code THEN the system SHALL preserve necessary error handling and logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up configuration files and remove unused environment variables, so that the setup process is simpler.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing configuration files THEN the system SHALL identify unused environment variables and config options
2. WHEN unused configurations are found THEN the system SHALL remove them from .env.example and config objects
3. WHEN cleaning configurations THEN the system SHALL update documentation to reflect the changes
